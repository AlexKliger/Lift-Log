# Lift Log
A journaling application for weight lifting.

## How It's Made:
React, Express, MongoDB

### Server:
The express server listens for requests and routes to an API that supports CRUD operations that accesses a mongoDB database.

### Client:
The client is a React app that makes various requests to the backend to add, delete, and update workouts.

## Lessons Learned:
My first attempt at a full stack application using Express and mongodDB for the backend and React for the frontend.
